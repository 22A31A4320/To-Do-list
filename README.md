To-Do List :

üìå Project Overview
The To-Do List project is a simple, beginner-friendly command-line application written in Python. It allows users to create, view, and manage a list of tasks they need to complete. The goal of this project is to help new programmers practice basic Python concepts like functions, file handling, loops, user input, and exception handling, all while building a tool they can actually use in daily life.

This project demonstrates how to use Python‚Äôs built-in file operations to store and update tasks persistently in a plain text file called todo.txt. Unlike temporary in-memory storage, this ensures that the user‚Äôs tasks remain available even after the program is closed and reopened.

üéØ Key Features
The To-Do List app provides four main features:

View Tasks: The user can view all current tasks saved in todo.txt. If the list is empty or the file doesn‚Äôt exist yet, the program shows a friendly message to let the user know there are no tasks.

Add a Task: The user can add a new task by entering a description. This task is appended to the todo.txt file, ensuring that it won‚Äôt be lost when the program exits.

Mark a Task as Complete: The user can mark a task as complete by selecting its number from the list. The program removes that task from the file, updating the to-do list automatically.

Quit: The user can exit the program gracefully at any time.

The app displays a simple menu with numbered choices, making it intuitive and easy to use. It continuously loops until the user chooses to quit.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The core of the program is organized into clear functions:

display() shows the main menu.

view() reads and prints the tasks from todo.txt.

add() lets the user add a new task and saves it.

complete() displays tasks, prompts the user for the task number to remove, updates the file, and confirms the action.

main() controls the loop and handles user choices.

It also includes robust error handling. For example, if the user enters an invalid task number when completing a task, or if the file doesn‚Äôt exist yet, the program won‚Äôt crash. Instead, it provides clear instructions to help the user try again.

‚úÖ Learning Value
This project is a practical demonstration of:

Reading and writing files in Python.

Using functions to organize code logically.

Working with loops and conditionals.

Handling exceptions gracefully.

Using the terminal for basic input/output.

Because of its simplicity, this project is perfect for beginners who want to build confidence and see how small Python scripts can solve real-world problems.

üìú Possible Extensions
Future improvements could include:

Adding due dates or task priorities.

Marking tasks as complete instead of deleting them.

Using JSON or a small database instead of plain text.

Creating a GUI version using tkinter or a web app version using Flask or Streamlit.
